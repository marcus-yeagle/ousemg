				<h3>Adding Value to our Members</h3>
				<p>We seek to add value to our members by providing them with the skills necessary to gain employment with many of the most respected firms across the financial services industry and beyond. We measure our performance in this area by seeking to achieve 100% senior placement by graduation. We have had great success in placing members in such industries as investment banking, corporate banking, corporate finance, sales and trading and public accounting. Below are some of the firms that have hired our members in the past.</p>

				<h3>Adding Value to our Alumni</h3>
				<p>We seek to add value to our alumni by establishing and maintaining a society of peers, whom share a profound connection through their OUSEMG experience. We strive to achieve this goal by conducting semi-weekly conference calls with alumni, arranging alumni networking trips, coordinating networking events during homecoming weekend and holding our annual OUSEMG banquet. Our alumni base is very strong and expansive with members spread throughout the United States and the world.</p>
